# Notes
- Border, Kim C. "Fixed point theorems with applications to economics and game theory." Cambridge Books (1990).

- tattonment is a popular algorithm, however, it only converges under gross substitutability assumptions. perhaps ADMM gives a tattonment-like algorithm that works in a relaxed setting.
- look at the welfare adjustment scheme in Codenotti et all 2005. it searches through weightings of the group welfare function to find an equilibrium. how does this connect with duality? is it monotone?
- are any of the non-convex problems monotone?
- weak gross substitutability implies easy cutting planes. monotone?
