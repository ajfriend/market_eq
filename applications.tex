\section{list of applications}
a list of notes of applications ot hte market stuff

from \cite[p.~104]{nisan2007algorithmic} says that \cite{kelly1997charging}
is a fisher program for TCP congestion problem. for more on these flow problems,
see chapter 22 of the nisan book and maybe chapter 18 on routing games. maybe
section 5.14? and this jain and vazirani paper?
\cite[\S5.13]{nisan2007algorithmic} gives a nice little Fisher application
to resource allocation markets, including a flow market.
\cite[\S5.14]{nisan2007algorithmic} gives a nice example from the previous
section of problem with a single
source and multiple sinks. However, it ends up with edges having zero prices,
so I don't know how that would work in the Arrow-debreu setting, but because
this is a Fisher problem, it should be ok.

\cite[\S7.5]{nisan2007algorithmic} suggests graphical exchange markets, where
agents can only trade with other agents if they share an edge in some graph.
for this to work, we need to allow for local good prices. but everything should
still carry through. cool!

see \cite{gomes2012pure} for a cloud computing market application.

see \cite{vazirani2010spending} for an internet advertising application.

\cite{vazirani2012notion} for throughput allocation problem on a wireless channel


see \cite{srikant2004mathematics,
kelly1997charging,
kelly1998rate,
low1999optimization,
yaiche2000game} for applications to communication network flow control.

\cite{ye2014competitive} communication spectrum market.
